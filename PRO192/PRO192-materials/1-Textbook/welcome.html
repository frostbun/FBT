        	<span>Subject Description</span>
        	<p>This subject introduces the student to object-oriented programming. The student learns to build reusable objects, encapsulate data and logic within a class, inherit one class from another and implement polymorphism.
Adhere to object-oriented programming principles including encapsulation, polymorphism and inheritance when writing program code </p>
